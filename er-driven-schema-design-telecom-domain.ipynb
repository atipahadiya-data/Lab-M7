    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "A telecom company wants to store Call Detail Records (CDR). The schema must be normalized, scalable, and analytics-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are asked to design the schema from scratch using ER principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Design a normalized relational schema for telecom CDR data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Requirements\n",
    "**Each call record includes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Caller number (phone number of the person making the call)\n",
    "- Receiver number (phone number of the person receiving the call)\n",
    "- Call start time (timestamp when call began)\n",
    "- Call duration (length of call in seconds)\n",
    "- Call type (local / STD / ISD)\n",
    "    - Local: Within same city\n",
    "    - STD: Same country, different city\n",
    "    - ISD: International call\n",
    "- Tower/location used (cell tower identifier where call was made)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A subscriber can make multiple calls\n",
    "- A subscriber can receive multiple calls\n",
    "- Calls are one-way (caller → receiver)\n",
    "- Tower information may be needed for location analysis\n",
    "- Call types may have different pricing rules\n",
    "- Need to support analytics queries (e.g., total calls per subscriber, calls by type, calls by tower)"
